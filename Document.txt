Our analyzer program must to analyze C++ keywords,functions,classes and variables.
Return count of that

first, we need data files where our keywords and others that we need to use to find
after that, we created our analyzer file for the program

what I do step by step`

1.  create a hash board for saving 
2. open the c++ file and read
3. create a function for analyzer keywords
    here I create loops for checking if in the file are keywords and 
    if was add our dictionary "keywords" value of 1 point
    and also sending our other function arguments 
4. create a function that returns the count of variables and other functions for functions count.
    and one more function for the class count in our c++ file
5. in function count function we are sending an argument to function_argument_count for checking 
    how much argument each function hash board
6. and in every function result we send our dictionary for showing our analyze


/// sorry if there was a bad code, I am still trying to get a more easy way for this problem :)
